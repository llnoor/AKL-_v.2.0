The program includes a set of laboratory experiments that cover the following topics:

Measuring the MWA

Main fields of research: Study of physical properties of materials with nonstandard conducting and magnetic characteristics like those of high-temperature superconductors and strongly correlated electronic systems; multilayered systems with alternating superconducting and magnetic layers.
